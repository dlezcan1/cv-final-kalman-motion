# Computer Vision: Final Project
## Kalman Filtering Motion Tracking
### Authors: Dimitri Lezcano, GunHo Ro, Harrison Riggott
This is a final project for a course in computer vision on motion tracking using Kalman Filtering.

## Results
### Simulated Videos
These movies can be seen as `*_results.mov` in the `data/simulated/' directory.

### Custom Videos
The best performing movie can be seen in the file `data/real/hold_square_results_cov-80_1-optimal.mov`.
Other iterations of our parameter tuning are in the `data/real/` directory as `hold_square_results-#.mov`
